# xray-rails Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

xray-rails is in a pre-1.0 state. This means that its APIs and behavior are
subject to breaking changes without deprecation notices. Until 1.0, version
numbers will follow a [Semver][]-ish `0.y.z` format, where `y` is incremented
when new features or breaking changes are introduced, and `z` is incremented for
lesser changes or bug fixes.

## [Unreleased][]

* Your contribution here!
* Added support for Rails 5.0.0.rc1.
  [#70](https://github.com/brentd/xray-rails/pull/70)

## [0.1.19][] (2016-05-06)

* Previous releases of xray-rails had a file permissions issue that caused a
  "can't load lib/xray/middleware" error on some systems. This should now be
  fixed. [#59](https://github.com/brentd/xray-rails/pull/59)
* The xray-rails JavaScript is now properly injected after `jquery2`. This means
  that projects using jQuery2 should now work with xray-rails out of the box.
